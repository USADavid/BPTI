Loading device for application Rf_Device from file '3sd1800a.nph' in environment /opt/Xilinx/10.1/ISE.
   "entity_vgagenerator" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc3sd1800a, package fg676, speed -4

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.260 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock. Note: For
   the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high". For a
   balance between the fastest runtime and best performance, set the effort level to "med".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.32 2008-05-28".

WARNING:Place:619 - This design is using a Side-BUFG site due to placement constraints on a BUFG, DCM, clock IOB or the
   loads of these components. It is recommended that Top and Bottom BUFG sites be used instead of Side-BUFG sites
   whenever possible because they can reach every clock region on the device. Side-BUFG sites can reach only clock
   regions on the same side of the device and also preclude the use of certain Top and Bottom BUFGs in the same clock
   region.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

Timing Score: 0

INFO:Timing:2761 - N/A entries in the Constraints list may indicate that the constraint does not cover any paths or that it has no
   requested value.
Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
