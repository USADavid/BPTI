WARNING:Place:619 - This design is using a Side-BUFG site due to placement constraints on a BUFG, DCM, clock IOB or the
   loads of these components. It is recommended that Top and Bottom BUFG sites be used instead of Side-BUFG sites
   whenever possible because they can reach every clock region on the device. Side-BUFG sites can reach only clock
   regions on the same side of the device and also preclude the use of certain Top and Bottom BUFGs in the same clock
   region.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

Timing Score: 0

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
